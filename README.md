A  performance test consisting of an AC capacity test must be used to determine  
that the Facility is performing as designed. The power rating test must be performed as a 
condition to Substantial Completion of the Facility.

These procedures are based on ASTM E2848-13, “Standard Test Method for 
Reporting Photovoltaic Non-Concentrator System Performance”, which may be used as 
an additional guide to perform the AC capacity test.
